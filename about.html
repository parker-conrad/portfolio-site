                <h2>Hello, I'm Conrad Parker</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Conrad Parker, a passionate and motivated software development student orrignally from Omaha, Nebraska. I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world around us, and that curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Computer Software Development at Indian Hills Community College.</p>
                <p>At Indian Hills, I’ve been developing a strong foundation in programming languages such as C#, Python, and Java, along with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. I’ve also gained experience working with SQL databases, cloud platforms such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, and Agile development practices that emphasize teamwork, adaptability, and continuous improvement. These experiences have not only built my technical skills but also taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and persistence when solving complex problems.</p>
                <p>Beyond the classroom, I enjoy challenging myself through personal coding projects and exploring new technologies that push my understanding further. I’m especially interested in cloud computing, software architecture, and AI-assisted development — fields that inspire me to think critically about how innovation can make a real impact.</p>
                <p>After completing my associate degree, I plan to continue my education by pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering or Computer Science. My goal is to expand my expertise and eventually work in a collaborative environment where I can contribute to meaningful, modern software solutions that improve how people and businesses operate.</p>
                <p>Outside of programming, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, exploring new ideas in tech, and giving back to my community through volunteer work. Whether I’m writing code, learning a new framework, or brainstorming creative ways to solve a problem, I’m always driven by curiosity and a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</p>
